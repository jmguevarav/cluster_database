# Clusters Zen Garden

A minimal, machine‑friendly collection of small and medium-size metal clusters, each treated as a “stone” in a computational zen garden.

The periodic table below serves as a quiet guide to the elemental scope of this repository. Each highlighted atom represents a family of clusters included in this collection. Each arrangement is shaped by its own symmetry, energy, and form. Like stones in a garden, these elements are not selected for hierarchy but for harmony, each offering a different perspective on the architecture of matter.
